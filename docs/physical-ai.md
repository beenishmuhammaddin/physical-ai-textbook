# Physical AI

Physical AI combines artificial intelligence with robotics to create intelligent machines that can interact with the physical environment.

## Key Components

- **Sensors:** Gather data from the environment (e.g., cameras, ultrasonic sensors).
- **Actuators:** Enable movement and actions (e.g., motors, servos).
- **Controllers:** Decide what actions to perform based on sensor data.

## Examples

- Self-driving cars using AI to navigate roads.
- Robotic arms in factories for assembling products.
- Drones for surveillance and delivery.

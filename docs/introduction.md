# Introduction

Physical AI is the study of intelligent systems that interact with the real world through sensors, actuators, and control mechanisms. Unlike purely software AI, physical AI focuses on tangible, robotic systems that can sense, move, and make decisions.

## Why Physical AI?

- Bridges the gap between AI algorithms and real-world actions.
- Enables robots to assist in daily tasks, healthcare, and industry.
- Offers hands-on experience in sensors, actuators, and control systems.

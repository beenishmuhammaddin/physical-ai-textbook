# Control Systems

Control systems govern how robots act in response to sensor input. They can be **open-loop** or **closed-loop**.

## Open-Loop Systems

- Do not use feedback.
- Example: A timed motor that runs for 5 seconds.

## Closed-Loop Systems

- Use feedback to correct errors.
- Example: A self-balancing robot that adjusts its position using gyroscope data.

## PID Controllers

- Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers are commonly used for precise movement.
